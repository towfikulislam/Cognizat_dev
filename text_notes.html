<!-- HTML tags always start with the < sign and end with a > tag. These are usually referred to as angle brackets -->
<!-- Every element starts and ends with a tag. From '<em> Towfik </em>' this whole thing is called element -->
<!-- '<em>' is called opening tag and '</em>' is called closing tag with '/' in the closing tag. <em> tag makes
    the work italic-->
<!-- Inline element: Elements does not create invisible block arount elements called inline element. 
    Ex: <P>,<h1>
    block element: opposite of inine elements are  called 'block element'. Ex: <em>, <br>, <strong>-->
<body>
    <p>My name is <mark>HTML</mark> and I will tell you all about <em>ME</em>.</p>

<!--<strong> tag makes a text bolder-->
<!--example is in the below-->
    <p>Did you know? Spaces, tabs, and line breaks are called
        <strong>whitespace</strong>.</p>

    <p>Did you
    know? 
        Spaces,
        tabs,
    and line
    breaks     are     called  <strong>whitespace</strong>.</p>

<!--Whitespaces includes spaces, tabs and line breaks. When the browser displays an HTML file, 
it treats a run of whitespace as a single space character-->
<!--The <br> tag is used just to break the line, it is not putting any specilization in the text other than 
just breaking the line. Thats why this element is called empty or void element.
If there are no <br> tag then html just put texts in the single line-->

Did you know? <br>
Spaces, tabs, and line breaks <br>
are called <strong>whitespace</strong>.

<!--P stands for paragraph. <p> and </p> are tags used for paragraph-->
<p>Once upon a time there was a baby tiger named Talia.</p> <p>Talia lived in a fearsome jungle in the 
middle of the fearsome jungle.</p> <p>Talia was the most fearsome of all, though she was only a baby.</p>

<!--Lets try <mark> which used for highlighting a text, in general in yellow. <sub> is used for subscript 
and <sup> is used for superscript text-->

This is a <mark>story</mark> about <br>
my <sub>life</sub>... <br>
Turned <sup>upside</sup> down..

<!--As you just discovered, the h1 element can be used for headlines, or section headings. There are actually 
six of these heading elements: h1 through h6. h1 is used for the main heading on a page, while the rest are 
used for subheadings. We use a smaller heading to show that one section is inside another section.
In contrast, if one section simply comes after the other then we use the same level of heading.
<br> tag just break the line but <p> tag not only group together sentences in to paragrapsh but also create
blocks around that paragraph, Thats why it called block element-->

    <p>This page is a collection of my awesome notes about HTML!</p>
<h2>The Web</h2>
    <p>The Web (or World Wide Web) is a collection of documents and other files. 
    Most of the documents are made using Hypertext Markup Language (HTML).</p>


<!--[div] is stands for division and this element divide the page into different sections with its texts. 
It also create invisible border arountexts like the way [p] block does alond with its margin, height, width. 
[div] block contains all other elements other than texts while [p] block is specifically for texts.-->

<div>
    <p>Call me Ishmael.</p>
    <p>Just don't call me late for dinner.</p>
</div>

<!-- [li] is stands for list. It has two category: ol(ordered list) & ul(unordered list). Ordered list meaning 
webpage will list item with numerics where ul will list item with bullet points. When listing something on a 
webpage it has to have <li> open tag and </li> close tag can be added but optional within either [ol] or [ul]-->
<!--Note that closing [li] is optional but [ol] & [ul] cosing tags are mandatory. Alos in [p] tag closing is 
optional as well-->

<ol>
    <li>Learn HTML.</li>
    <li>Learn CSS.</li>
    <li>Learn Python.</li>
    <li>Save the world.</li>
</ol>
  This line should not be part of the list!
  (But it will be, if you forget to put a closing tag!)
