			<p>Despite their size, Bengal tigers can climb trees effectively, however, they are not 
			as agile as the smaller leopard, which hides its kills from other predators in the trees. 
			Bengal tigers are also strong and frequent swimmers, often ambushing drinking or swimming prey or 
			chasing prey that has retreated into water.</p>
